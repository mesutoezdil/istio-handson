### Step-by-Step Guide for Installing Istio 1.24.0 on Kubernetes

It is possible to perform this setup in different environments. I tried it in the [K3s playground environment by iximiuz](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds/k3s). Below, you can find all the steps and code step by step.

### 1. **Create a Directory for Istio Installation**
```bash
mkdir istio-installation
```
This step creates a dedicated directory to organize Istio installation files.

---

### 2. **Download Istio**
```bash
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
```
This command fetches the Istio installation script, downloads the latest version (1.24.0), and extracts it into a folder named `istio-1.24.0`.

---

### 3. **Move the Downloaded Istio Folder into the Created Directory**
```bash
mv istio-1.24.0/ istio-installation/
```
The downloaded `istio-1.24.0` directory is moved under `istio-installation` for better project structure.

---

### 4. **Navigate to the Istio Directory**
```bash
cd istio-installation/
```
Change into the newly created directory where Istio files are stored.

---

### 5. **Verify the Istio Files are Downloaded**
```bash
ls
```
This confirms that the `istio-1.24.0` folder is present in the `istio-installation` directory.

---

### 6. **Navigate to the Istio Binary Directory**
```bash
cd istio-1.24.0/bin
```
Navigate to the `bin` directory where the `istioctl` binary is located.

---

### 7. **Verify the Presence of `istioctl`**
```bash
ls
```
Ensure that the `istioctl` binary is present in the directory.

---

### 8. **Add `istioctl` to the PATH Environment Variable**
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/laborant/istio-installation/istio-1.24.0/bin
```
This step temporarily adds the directory containing `istioctl` to the `PATH` environment variable, enabling global access to the binary.

---

### 9. **Verify `istioctl` Command**
```bash
istioctl
```
Test the `istioctl` command. If the `PATH` was correctly set, the command should list available options and commands.

---

### 10. **Make the PATH Change Permanent**
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/laborant/istio-installation/istio-1.24.0/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Appending the `export PATH` command to `~/.bashrc` ensures that the `istioctl` binary remains globally accessible even after a terminal restart.

---

### 11. **Verify Kubernetes Cluster Accessibility**
```bash
kubectl get ns
kubectl get pods
```
Verify that the Kubernetes cluster is accessible and operational. The namespace (`ns`) and pods list should display correctly.

---

### 12. **Install Istio on the Kubernetes Cluster**
```bash
istioctl install
```
The installation process applies Istio's default profile to the cluster. Confirm the prompt with `y`.

---

### Expected Installation Output:
```plaintext
This will install the Istio 1.24.0 profile "default" into the cluster. Proceed? (y/N) y
‚úî Istio core installed ‚õµÔ∏è
‚úî Istiod installed üß†
‚úî Ingress gateways installed üõ¨
‚úî Installation complete
```

The Istio control plane and ingress gateway are successfully installed in the cluster.

### 13. **Verify Istio Installation Namespaces**
```bash
kubectl get ns
```
This command lists all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster. You should see the `istio-system` namespace, which is created as part of the Istio installation.

---

### 14. **Check Istio Pods in the `istio-system` Namespace**
```bash
kubectl get pod -n istio-system
```
This verifies that the Istio control plane (`istiod`) and ingress gateway pods are running successfully.  

**Expected Output:**
```plaintext
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-ingressgateway-8cd544cbd-wnvlg   1/1     Running   0          8m8s
istiod-6b5fb7b484-7lbjw                1/1     Running   0          8m16s
```

For the following manifest.yaml file, we will use only the relevant file in the repository belonging to Google: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml

### 15. **Apply Kubernetes Manifest File**

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

This command deploys all services, deployments, and service accounts defined in the provided `kubernetes-manifests.yaml` file to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Expected Output:**
```plaintext
deployment.apps/emailservice created
service/emailservice created
serviceaccount/emailservice created
...
deployment.apps/adservice created
service/adservice created
serviceaccount/adservice created
```

---

### 16. **Verify Pods in the Default Namespace**

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

This command lists all the pods deployed in the default namespace.

**Example Initial Output:**
```plaintext
NAME                                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
adservice-997b6fc95-4fhmn                0/1     Running             0          20s
cartservice-59d7459964-br6q5             0/1     Running             0          21s
...
recommendationservice-7d59447ccc-bsbfp   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          22s
redis-cart-558f8d8d44-5k8g8              1/1     Running             0          21s
```

Pods might initially show as `ContainerCreating` or `Init:0/1` because Kubernetes is pulling images and starting containers.

---

### 17. **Check Pods Again After Initialization**

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

**Expected Final Output:**
```plaintext
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
adservice-997b6fc95-4fhmn                1/1     Running   0          80s
cartservice-59d7459964-br6q5             1/1     Running   0          81s
checkoutservice-855ff8d99-fwwnw          1/1     Running   0          82s

recommendationservice-7d59447ccc-bsbfp   1/1     Running   0          82s
redis-cart-558f8d8d44-5k8g8              1/1     Running   0          81s
shippingservice-fb69f4985-7z69r          1/1     Running   0          81s
```

At this point, all pods should be in the `Running` state.
